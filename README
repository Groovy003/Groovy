This project contains sample code written in the Groovy programming langauge.

It is organized in 3 directories:
1. basic_examples - This directory contains basic Groovy examples that show how to use Strings, lists, maps, etc in Groovy

2. idiomatic_groovy - This directory contains examples which show how to code the Groovy way. There will be examples which show how to iterate across lists, howto create and parse XML structures, etc.

3. mini_projects - This directory contains mini_projects which are very small self contained projects that bring together the concepts explained in basic_examples and idiomatic_groovy.
